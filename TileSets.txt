Introduction
------------

This is an outline of the repeating patterns evident in the texture library, and how they
relate to region and climate.


Region Texture Patterns
-----------------------

The various regions in Daggerfall seem to follow a certain pattern with regards to ordering in
the texture library. A range of 100 is allocated for each region, and standard texture sets
with fixed offsets are found within each range. Some of these offsets are "reserved" and
contain a variety of textures, such as doors, carpets, signs and unique locations. The entire
block of 200-299 is reserved for non-region textures, such as monsters.


Region Type Ranges
------------------

Following are the ranges that region textures fall into.

000 - 099	Desert
100 - 199	Mountain
300 - 399	Temperate / Woodland
400 - 499	Swamp


Base Textures
-------------

Following are standard base textures. Add this number to the region type to discover the
appropriate texture set for that region. The offsets marked as "Reserved" contain a variety
of special textures that typically aren't related to region type. In some cases the reserved
texture may not even be present. This could indicate free positions in the library never
filled during development. The textures marked with a '*' support a climate offset.

Reserved A		000 - 001

*Terrain		002

Reserved B		005 - 006

*Ruins			007
*Castle			009
Palace Int.		011
*City A			012
*City B			014
City Int.		016
*City Walls		017
Crypt A			019
Crypt B			020

Reserved C		021

Dungeons A		022
Dungeons B		023
Dungeons C		024
Dungeons NEWCs		025
*Farm			026
Farm Int.		028
*Fences			029

Reserved D		031 - 034

*Mages Guild		035
Mages Guild Int.	037
*Manor			038
Manor Int.		040
Marble Floors		041
*Merchant Homes		042
Merchant Homes Int.	044
Mines			045

Reserved E		046

Natural Caves		047
Paintings		048

Reserved F		049 - 057

*Tavern Exteriors	058
Tavern Int.		060
*Temple Exteriors	061
Temple Int.		063
*Village		064
Village Int.		066

Reserved G		067

Sewer			068
*Roofs			069

Reserved H		071 - 073

Door Set		074

Reserved I		075 - 099


Climate Offsets
---------------

The Desert region never experiences snow, and instead has more base textures. These should
be referenced explicity in the objects that use them. For regions 100 and higher, a +1 can
be added during Winter for a snow texture. For all Terrain textures, a +2 can be added during rain.

+1	Winter	(objects and terrain)
+2	Rain	(terrain only)


Formula
-------

The formula for determining a texture set is:

Region + Base + Climate = TextureIndex

For example, to find the texture for a Mountain Castle during winter:

100 + 9 + 1 = 110 (TEXTURE.110 = Mountain Castle Snow)

Another example, to find the ground texture for a swamp during rain

400 + 2 + 2 = 404 (TEXTURE.404 = Swamp Terrain Rain)

For most 3D objects in ARCH3D.BSA the appropriate base texture is referenced explicitly. A BLOCKS.BSA
parser can check the region of a texture set and its base offset to see if climate offsets apply.
It's possible the actual region number 0, 1, 3, 4 is referenced somewhere in MAPS.BSA or WOODS.WLD.


Afterword
---------

In some cases the description for a texture set is misleading. For example:

TEXTURE.129	Mountain Fences Snow
TEXTURE.130	Mountain Fences

Seem to be the wrong way around. However when you extract the textures in these archives, it is
the description that's actually wrong. The +1 winter offset is still correct in this case.
